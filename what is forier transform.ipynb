    "Fourier Analysis\n",
    "Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourier analysis probably is the most commonly used technique for calculating the spectral composition of a signal. \n",
    "Results of a Fourier transformation usually are represented in 1 of 2 forms, a power spectrum or a spectrogram.\n",
    "A power spectrum is used to present the frequency and amplitude content of part of a signal at a particular point in time\n",
    "(Fig. 3). This part can be the entire signal (i.e., echolocation call) or some fraction of it.\n",
    "A spectrogram differs from a power spectrum in that it also contains information on how frequency and \n",
    "amplitude of a signal change over time \n",
    "Essentially, a spectrogram is the result of a series of Fourier transformations applied sequentially to a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple method for determining the frequency of an oscillating object is to look at it with a stroboscope.\n",
    "By slowly changing the flash rate, the object appears to be motionless at only 1 particular flash frequency,\n",
    "which coincides with the object's oscillatory frequency. A Fourier transformation attempts something similar.\n",
    "When applying a Fourier transformation to a waveform, the waveform is multiplied by an artificial waveform of \n",
    "a particular frequency,\n",
    "and the results are summed over a range of frequencies. If the input waveform consists only of 1 frequency,\n",
    "the sum of the multiplication will peak only at 1 particular frequency, just as in the example of the stroboscope. \n",
    "This peak will occur at the frequency that is equal to the frequency of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, a Fourier analysis is somewhat more complicated because phase information must be included in the calculations.\n",
    "In terms of our stroboscope example, it is possible to “freeze” the oscillating object by choosing the appropriate flash rate,\n",
    "but the target could be frozen at any position (0–2π) of its cycle, depending on the phase difference between the stroboscope and the object.\n",
    "The Fourier transformation constructs the artificial waveform such that both frequency and phase match those of the real input waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size, or length, of a Fourier transformation is measured in points.\n",
    "The number of points used in a transformation represents the number values from the signal to be analyzed and\n",
    "the number of values returned by the transformation. \n",
    "For example,\n",
    "a 512-point Fourier transformation will analyze 512 sequential values from the waveform and return 512 frequency–amplitude values.\n",
    "Only 256 values of the sample will be usable;\n",
    "the remainder belongs to the imaginary part of the signal.\n",
    "The frequency resolving power of a transformation depends on the length of the signal being analyzed. \n",
    "The shorter the signal waveform to be matched with the artificial waveform, the worse the frequency resolution.\n",
    "The resolution of a transformation is constrained by the uncertainty principle (Beecher 1988),\n",
    "which states that frequency and time are inversely related. This principle can be represented by Δt = nf /sf and Δf = 1/Δt,\n",
    "where nf is the length of the Fourier transformation and sf is the sampling rate used when the signal was digitized.\n",
    "Therefore,\n",
    "a trade-off exists between Δf (frequency resolution) and Δt (time resolution). As a general rule, \n",
    "the larger the number of points used in the transformation, the better the frequency resolution will be .\n",
    "However, time resolution will be poor. If a small number of points are used,\n",
    "the inverse is true.\n",
    "Fourier transformation on its own gives an adequate picture of the frequency content of a signal only if the input waveform is continuous. Sounds produced by bats, however, are often pulsed and therefore discontinuous.\n",
    "The start and end points of data to be transformed almost certainly will be nonzero values because sample points are unlikely to coincide with zero-crossings.\n",
    "Therefore, matching the signal with artificial waveforms used by the Fourier transform will be difficult and may lead to frequency side lobes appearing in the output.\n",
    "To avoid these spurious ripples, most signals are first weighted before being transformed.\n",
    "Most weighting functions (e.g., Hamming windows) are simple bell-shaped functions that taper off the far ends of the signal. In this way,\n",
    "truncated parts of the signal are de-emphasized and hence frequencies of the side lobes are reduced.\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of Fourier analysis is that very little information is lost from the signal during the transformation. The Fourier transform maintains information on amplitude, harmonics,\n",
    "and phase and uses all parts of the waveform to translate the signal into the frequency domain. \n",
    "Preservation of phase information by the Fourier transformation means that the signal can be transformed back into the time domain. Power spectra and spectrograms do not contain phase information.\n",
    "Fourier analysis does not rely on arbitrary thresholds; therefore, frequency and time resolution are calculated easily, making direct comparisons with other studies possible. This type of analysis also is relatively insensitive to noise,\n",
    "making it very useful for analyzing bat signals.\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The major disadvantage of the Fourier transformation is the inherent compromise that exists between frequency and time resolution. \n",
    "The length of Fourier transformation used can be critical in ensuring that subtle changes in frequency over time, \n",
    "which are very important in bat echolocation calls, are seen.\n",
    "It may be that no single length of transform is ideal for a particular signal; several transformations, each of a different length, may be required before a signal can be described adequately.\n",
    "In a signal that is masked heavily with noise, the start and end points of a call may be more obvious in a spectrogram, because the high-amplitude noise is often of lower spectral density and lower frequency than the echolocation call of interest. \n",
    "However, because of the windowing calculation of the spectrogram, it is less advisable to measure duration of a signal from a spectrogram. Such measurements contain some degree of imprecision,\n",
    "which can be compensated for only after elaborate calibration of a specific spectrogram setting \n",
    "(window size, window shift) against the time–amplitude display.\n",
