    "Advantages of frequency filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Frequency filtering is much more efficient in convolving images with large kernels.\n",
    "    It also useful in the reverse process of 'deconvolution',\n",
    "    for example when the output image and the Point Spread Function (PSF) are known,\n",
    "    and the input image needs to be reconstructed.\n",
    "    Similar as the forward convolution may be processed by a multiplication of the frequency components of the imageand the PSF,\n",
    "    the deconvolution can be processed by dividing the frequency components of the output image with \n",
    "    the corresponding PSF components in the frequency domain.\n",
    "    In this reverse process one should be careful how to handle frequency components of the PSF which are near zero,\n",
    "    as they will blow-up the noise from your input image into large artifacts in your reconstructed image.\n",
    "    There are many methods available to regularize such deconvolutions."
